This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue: specificity conflicts. The `bug.css` file contains code that produces an unexpected layout due to conflicting CSS rules.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.css`, demonstrates how to resolve this conflict by using more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (use cautiously).  See the comments in the code for more detail.
