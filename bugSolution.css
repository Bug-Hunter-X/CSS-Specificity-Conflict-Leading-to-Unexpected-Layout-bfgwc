There are several ways to solve this specificity conflict. One approach is to make the `.container` selector more specific by adding an extra class to the sidebar's container or modifying the `#sidebar` selector. Here's an improved version:

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.container #sidebar {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the `!important` flag, but this is generally discouraged due to its potential for making CSS harder to maintain.

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

#sidebar {
  width: 200px !important; /* Use cautiously */
  float: left;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```
Choose the solution that best fits your project's structure and maintainability considerations.
