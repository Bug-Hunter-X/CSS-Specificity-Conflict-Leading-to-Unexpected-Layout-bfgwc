The following CSS code snippet demonstrates a common issue where specificity conflicts arise, leading to unexpected styling behavior.  The `#sidebar` ID selector is more specific than the `.container` class selector, so the `#sidebar` styles will override the `.container` styles, even if they are declared later in the stylesheet. This often causes unexpected layout issues.

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

#sidebar {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```
